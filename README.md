# Introduction
  BotSumo (Robot-sumo), is a sport in which two robots attempt to push each other out of a
  circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The engineering challenges are for the
  robot to find its opponent (usually accomplished with infrared or ultra-sonic sensors) and to
  push it out of the flat arena. A robot should also avoid leaving the arena, usually by means
  of a sensor that detects the edge.

# Details
  Team must build a completely autonomous robot. It has to push the opponent robot out of
  the arena. It must have some mechanism to find the opponent bot.

# Bot Specifications
  The robot must be able to fit inside a box with dimensions of 250 mm X 250 mm X 250 mm
  (l x b x h) and weigh less than or equal to 3 kg.
  The machine must use only mechanical power converted from a source of electrical energy.
  There mustn't be any mechanism which damages the opponent's bot.
  The robot must have some mechanism/sensors to detect the opponent bot in order to
  engage in a duel. Not fulfilling this specification may lead to disqualification.
  The machine must be fully autonomous. i.e., no manual control is to be present.

# Power Supply
  The participants should use an on-board power supply, i.e., the power source should be on
  the bot itself
  The voltage between any two points should be less than or equal to 24 V DC at all times
  during the run.

# GamePlay(It may vary)

  # Round 1
  The 2 fighting bots will be kept at the same distance from each other and from the edge,
  just before the round begins.
  One round will be of 3 minutes.
  There will be total of 3 rounds.
  To win the round the bot must push or throw the opponent out of the arena completely.

  # Final Round
  The 4 bots will be placed at different ends of the arena not facing each other, just before the
  round begins.
  One round will be of 7 minutes.
  There will be total of 3 rounds.
  To win the round the bot must push or throw the opponent out of the arena completely.


# Game Rules
  The machines you build will be first checked for size and safety.
  Only one team member is allowed to handle the bot. Other team members are not allowed
  to enter the arena.
  The bot should not be stationary for more than 5 sec at any point of time during the match
  (with the exception when there is a contact with the opponent's bot).
  Robot behaviour must be non-offensive, non-destructive, and non-harmful to humans and
  the facilities. This is an immutable principle, even if the behaviour is unintentional or not by
  design.
  During inspection (and at any time during the event), the judges may require safety changes
  or other modifications to meet the harmlessness requirement. Harmful robots are either
  not allowed to compete at all or are later disqualified if potential harmful issues are proven
  or revealed in battle.
  The machine should not leave spare parts in the arena at any stage. This can lead to round
  loss or may even lead to disqualification.
  The judges can ask for an explanation of any mechanism on the bot and there would be an
  immediate disqualification of defaulters of any kind.
  Bot's code will be checked for hard coding before trail is allowed.
