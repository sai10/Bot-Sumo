# Introduction
  BotSumo (Robot-sumo), is a sport in which two autonomous robots attempt to push each other out 
  of a circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The engineering challenges are for the
  robot to find its opponent (usually accomplished with infrared or ultra-sonic sensors) and to
  push it out of the flat arena. A robot should also avoid leaving the arena, usually by means
  of a sensor that detects the edge.

## Details
  Bot has to push the opponent robot out of the arena. It must have some mechanism to find the opponent bot.

## Bot Specifications
  The robot must be able to fit inside a box with dimensions of 250 mm X 250 mm X 250 mm
  (l x b x h) and weigh less than or equal to 3 kg.
  The machine must use only mechanical power converted from a source of electrical energy.
  There mustn't be any mechanism which damages the opponent's bot.
  The robot must have some mechanism/sensors to detect the opponent bot in order to
  engage in a duel. 

# Game Rules
  The bot should not be stationary for more than 5 sec at any point of time during the match
  (with the exception when there is a contact with the opponent's bot).
  Robot behaviour must be non-offensive, non-destructive, and non-harmful to humans and
  the facilities. This is an immutable principle, even if the behaviour is unintentional or not by
  design.
